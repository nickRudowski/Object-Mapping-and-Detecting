# Object Detection and Panorama Creation

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a professional image dataset and applying foundational image processing techniques to detect objects, draw bounding boxes, and create a panoramic image from multiple fragmented datasets. Through these tasks, you'll enhance your understanding of feature detection, object identification, and image stitching.

## Objectives

### Dataset Preparation:
1. Create a dataset of 10 objects and 30 scene images with increasing complexity, including clutter and occlusion.
2. Create a panoramic dataset containing 10 images from multiple viewpoints of a scene with all 10 objects.

### Tasks:
1. **Task 1**: Identify objects in each scene and evaluate the systemâ€™s performance.
2. **Task 2**: Draw bounding boxes around detected objects in scene images.
3. **Task 3**: Stitch panoramic images and annotate detected objects.
