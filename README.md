# Object-Mapping-and-Detecting
Project Overview
This project involves creating a professional image dataset and applying foundational image processing techniques to detect objects, draw bounding boxes, and create a panoramic image from multiple fragmented datasets. Through these tasks, you'll enhance your understanding of feature detection, object identification, and image stitching.

Objectives
Dataset Preparation:

Create a dataset of 10 objects and 30 scene images with increasing complexity, including clutter and occlusion.
Create a panoramic dataset containing 10 images from multiple viewpoints of a scene with all 10 objects.
Tasks:

Task 1: Identify objects in each scene and evaluate the systemâ€™s performance.
Task 2: Draw bounding boxes around detected objects in scene images.
Task 3: Stitch panoramic images and annotate detected objects.
